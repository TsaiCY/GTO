# GTO Project
### 1. Introduction

   Welcome to the "**Global Teleconnection Operator (GTO)**" project! In this project, we build a multi-linear regression model to characterize linear relations between sea surface temperature (SST) and several climate variables (e.g., air temperature, precipitation) over different regions in Antarctica.


### 2. Applications

   GTO can be applied to address various aspects of regional climate changes based on SST:
   - Regional climate changes over differnt continetns [[Li et al., (2012)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD017186/abstract)]
   - Climate indices, such as NAO, PNA [[Li and Forest (2014)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00231.1)]
   - Regional climate and drought conditions over river basins [[Tsai et al., (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-014-2449-1)]
   - Polar climate (Greenland/Antarctica *This project!*)

### 3. Scripts

   This project comprises several elements, and we will point you to the jupyter notebooks that introduce brief background with sample scripts to conduct associated tasks:
   - Calculate GTO ([GTO_SensitivityMap_CAM3_ANT.ipynb](https://github.com/TsaiCY/GTO/blob/master/GTO_SensitivityMap_CAM3_ANT.ipynb), [jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TsaiCY/GTO/blob/9ac1cddbb48b517be5100982c71f9522eebe0a01/GTO_SensitivityMap_CAM3_ANT.ipynb))
     - In this script, we calculate GTO for 5 regions in Antarctica for austral summer but we only show the GTO maps and the interpretations for Amundsen Sea Embayment (AMD).
   - Perform reconstructions (*ongoing work, script coming soon*)
   - Compare reconstructed results to observations, other model output... (*ongoing work, script coming soon*)


Scripts for model diagnostics will be avaiable soon:
- Compare different versions of CAM output against observations and CMIP5
